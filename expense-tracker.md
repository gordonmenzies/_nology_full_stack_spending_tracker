# Post Course – Full Stack Project

### Overview

Ever found it hard to know exactly what you are spending? This week we’re going to be building an expense tracker. In recent years, apps like Emma and Plum have risen in popularity, as they link to your bank account, and track/categorise your spending. At the end of the month you can then see a breakdown of how much you have spent/received... and where it has all gone! We would like you to build your own!

### Goals

- An easy to use app: The key with apps like this is they should take seconds to use, to ensure the user tracks all purchases. Whilst they will be added manually instead of automatically from a bank transaction, the process should be short and sweet.
- Should capture useful info (amount, vendor, date/time etc)
- Should show use analytics
  - Use good packages, such as **ChartJS** to show detailed breakdown of where their money has gone
  - Another example is a bar chart/graph of how a category has changed over time (e.g. spent £250 last month... £500 the month before... only £60 this month etc)

### Specifications

- Users need an account to use (up to you how you authenticate!)
- Responsive... this will be used almost exclusively on a mobile screen, so we would recommend a mobile-first approach.
- This is a full stack application so data should be persistent.
